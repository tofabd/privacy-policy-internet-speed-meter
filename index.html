  <h1>Privacy Policy – Internet Speed Meter</h1>
  <p class="meta">Effective Date: January 18, 2026 &nbsp;|&nbsp; Last Updated: January 18, 2026</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>Internet Speed Meter ("we", "our", or "the app") respects your privacy. This policy explains what information the Android app accesses, how it is used, and the limited circumstances under which information may be shared. We designed the app to function primarily on your device without transmitting your network usage statistics or history to our own servers.</p>

  <h2>2. Summary at a Glance</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>No account, login, or personal identity collected.</li>
    <li>Firebase Analytics collects anonymized app usage data to improve stability.</li>
    <li>Network data usage metrics processed locally only.</li>
    <li>Ads provided via Google AdMob (may use Advertising ID) – can be removed via in-app purchase.</li>
    <li>Optional one-time "Remove Ads" purchase available to stop all advertisements.</li>
    <li>GDPR consent for EEA/UK users via Google's User Messaging Platform.</li>
    <li>You can reset data in-app or uninstall to remove all local data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Information the App Processes (Device-Local)</h2>
  <p><strong>Collected/Read Locally for Display & Functionality Only:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Network data usage (mobile and WiFi) via Android TrafficStats API and NetworkStatsManager API – total bytes sent/received. NetworkStatsManager requires Usage Access permission to provide accurate system-level network statistics.</li>
    <li>Real-time download and upload speeds calculated from network usage deltas.</li>
    <li>Network connection state (WiFi connected, mobile data enabled, no connection).</li>
    <li>Daily, monthly, and custom date range data usage statistics stored locally.</li>
    <li>User preferences (theme, notification settings, speed unit preferences, graph display options).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This information never leaves your device. It is not transmitted to any server controlled by us.</p>

  <h2>4. What We Do <em>Not</em> Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>No name, email, address, phone, contacts, calendar, photos, media, files, messages, or precise location.</li>
    <li>No per-app data usage or app-specific network activity.</li>
    <li>No browsing history, URLs visited, or network traffic content.</li>
    <li>No biometric, health, or other sensitive personal data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. How Information Is Used Locally</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To display real-time internet speed (download/upload) in notification and app interface.</li>
    <li>To generate on-device graphs and historical data statistics.</li>
    <li>To show a persistent foreground notification with current network speed (if enabled).</li>
    <li>To track daily and monthly data usage totals for user reference.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or otherwise share any user data.</p>

  <h2>6. Local Storage & Retention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Data usage history is stored in local files (daily, monthly, weekly data files) in app-private storage.</li>
    <li>User preferences and settings stored in SharedPreferences.</li>
    <li>All locally stored data is deleted if you use the in-app reset data option or uninstall the app.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Firebase Analytics (Google)</h2>
  <p>The app integrates Firebase Analytics to improve app stability and user experience. This service collects:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Anonymous app usage data (screen views, feature usage, session duration, ad interaction events).</li>
    <li>Device information (model, OS version, app version, language settings).</li>
    <li>General geographic region (inferred from IP address, not precise GPS location).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This data is used solely to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Identify and fix bugs and performance issues.</li>
    <li>Understand how users interact with the app to improve features.</li>
    <li>Monitor app stability and user experience metrics.</li>
    <li>Optimize ad placement and frequency.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>No personally identifiable information</strong> (name, email, phone number, or contacts) is collected by Firebase. All data is anonymized and aggregated. Refer to Google's policies for full details: <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firebase Privacy &amp; Security</a> and <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

  <h2>8. Advertising (Google AdMob)</h2>
  <p>The app integrates Google Mobile Ads (AdMob) to display banner, interstitial, and app open ads. AdMob may collect:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Advertising ID (resettable), IP address, device information, coarse location (inferred), and performance metrics for ad delivery and fraud prevention.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Refer to Google's policies for full details: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Privacy Policy</a>. You may opt out or limit personalized ads via Android settings or <a href="https://adssettings.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://adssettings.google.com</a>.</p>
  
  <p><strong>EEA / UK / Switzerland Users:</strong> The app uses Google's User Messaging Platform (UMP) SDK to collect consent for personalized advertising in compliance with GDPR and IAB's Transparency and Consent Framework (TCF v2.2). Upon first launch or when consent expires, you will be presented with a consent dialog where you can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Accept personalized ads from Google and its ad partners</li>
    <li>Decline and receive non-personalized or limited ads instead</li>
    <li>Manage individual vendor purposes and preferences</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Your consent choices are stored locally on your device and can be changed at any time by clearing app data. For more information, see <a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/10107561" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google's Consent Management Platform</a>.</p>

  <p><strong>Removing Ads:</strong> You can permanently remove all advertisements by purchasing the "Remove Ads" in-app product (see Section 9 below). Once purchased, no ad-related data will be collected or processed.</p>

  <h2>10. Foreground Service & Notification</h2>
  <p>The app runs a foreground service to monitor network speed continuously and keep the notification active. This service does not transmit data externally; it only reads system network statistics (TrafficStats API) locally.</p>

  <h2>11. Permissions Used</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><code>INTERNET</code> / <code>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE</code> / <code>ACCESS_WIFI_STATE</code>: Required to monitor network connection status AND to load AdMob ads and send anonymized Firebase data.</li>

    <li><code>com.google.android.gms.permission.AD_ID</code>: Enables access to Advertising ID for Google AdMob advertising. Not used if you purchase "Remove Ads".</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>12. Security</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>All data remains within Android's standard app sandbox.</li>
    <li>No custom remote storage or transmission to third-party servers beyond Google ad requests and Firebase analytics.</li>
